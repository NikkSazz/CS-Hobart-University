# School Work - Hobart University

I document and share my coursework from Hobart University. 
This repository includes projects, assignments, and notes from the computer science courses I have taken so far. 
Below is an overview of the courses completed, along with their descriptions.

## Courses Completed

### ✅ CPSC 225: Intermediate Programming

- Basic data structures (lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, hash tables)
- Recursion
- Common algorithms (searching and sorting)
- Generic programming
- Object-oriented programming with class hierarchies

The course is taught in **Java**, with a required lab component for hands-on coding experience. This course is essential for the computer science major and minor.

### ✅ CPSC 229: Foundations of Computation
**Description:**
This course introduces the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computer science, with topics including:
- Propositional and predicate logic
- Sets and functions
- Formal languages
- Finite automata and regular expressions
- Grammars
- Turing machines

This course demonstrates the intersection of theory and practical computing and is a requirement for the computer science major.

### ✅ CPSC 220: Introduction to Computer Architecture
**Description:**
This course explores how hardware executes software. Key topics include:
- Designing digital logic circuits to process binary data
- Developing programs in assembly and machine languages
- Analyzing central processing unit (CPU) operations during program execution

A required lab component reinforced theoretical concepts with practical application. This course builds directly on knowledge from **CPSC 124** and is a requirement for the computer science major.

### ✅ CPSC 124: Introduction to Programming
**Description:**
An introductory course on the theory and practice of computer programming, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming techniques. Topics covered include:
- Control structures
- Objects and classes
- Inheritance
- Simple data structures
- Basic concepts of software development

The programming language used in this course is **Java**. A required lab component provided hands-on experience. This course is foundational for the computer science major and minor.
