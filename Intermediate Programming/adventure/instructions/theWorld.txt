The World

Your world should be the typical Adventure-style world consisting 
of a collection of interconnected rooms. 
Each room can have exits to the north, south, east, and west 
though not every room will have exits in all possible directions. 
Each room has a unique name/short description which identifies it, 
as well as a longer description.

Rooms may also contain items, which the player may pick up, carry along, 
use, and drop. Each item has a name and a description associated with it.

You must have at least 10 different rooms, with an interesting 
series of routes between them. (Simply connecting the first room to the second 
to the third is not very interesting â€” there should be multiple ways you 
can navigate through the world.) There must be at least 5 items, which are 
initially placed in different rooms. (Don't put them all in one place.)
