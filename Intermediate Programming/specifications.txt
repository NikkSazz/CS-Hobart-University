Commands

Your game must support the following commands:

GO direction, MOVE direction, or just direction, 
where direction is NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST — if the player can move in that direction, 
she should move to the new room and that room's description and contents should displayed 
(use the long description if the room has not been visited before and the short description if it has); 
if the player can't move in that direction, an appropriate error message should be displayed

TAKE item, GET item — player picks up the item named

DROP item — player drops the item named

LOOK — display the current room's long description, exit directions, and contents

LOOK item — display the item's description; should 
only be allowed if the item is in the current room or is being carried by the player 
(otherwise an appropriate message should be displayed)

INVENTORY — list the names of the items the player is currently carrying

SCORE — print out the player's current score

QUIT — end the game

Commands are shown in all caps for clarity, but your game should not be case-sensitive. 
Where there are synonyms listed (such as TAKE and GET), your program should support all of the versions listed. 
Also note that item names may consist of more than one word, but there won't be anything else on the line — 
i.e. for those commands that involve items, everything after the command can be taken as the item name.
