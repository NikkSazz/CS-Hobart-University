# Flip Game

**Flip** is a fast-paced dice game where players roll 5 dice to match specific combinations and score points. The goal is to be the first to reach a target score (usually 50 points).

## Setup
- Each player receives 5 dice.
- Players choose the target score (e.g., 50 points).


## How to Play
On each turn, the player either flips one of their own dice or plays one of their opponent's dice. However, players may not flip the same die twice without first playing one of the opponent's dice.
- **Flipping** means to turn the die to the opposite side of what is showing; since the top and bottom numbers of 6-sided dice always sum to 7, this means that the new value of a flipped die is 7 minus the old value. (6 flips to 1, 5 flips to 2, 4 flips to 3, 3 flips to 4, etc.)
- **Playing** means to put one of the opponent's dice into the middle of the table. They can then remove any number of dice whose total value does not exceed the value of the die played. For example, if a 6 is played, up to 5 points worth of dice can be removed from the middle.
