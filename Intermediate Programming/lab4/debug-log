StringSetTester - intersection()
fails an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This is because i1, which is used for this.elements_, is out of bounds.
I believe it is because of the || statements instead of &&
So that could be a possible error.
however the actual error is from the For loop
the i++ at the end, should not iterate for every loop,
since i is used as an index for the new elements in the new array, 
it should only go up, as you insert new elements.
i is also used as a size for the StringSet constructor, used for the 
size_ variable.
